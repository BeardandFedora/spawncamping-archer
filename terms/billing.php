			<li>Subscription and usage fees are nonrefundable.</li>
			<li>Business Users cannot be decreased during a Term.  Pro-rata increases Fees resulting from increases in Business Users will be invoiced in the next monthly invoice for monthly subscription Customers and in an invoice generated quarterly for all other Customers.</li>
			<li>For Customers paying by credit/debit charge, Customers are required to keep a current and valid credit/debit card information on file to charge for Fees.</li>
			<li>For Customers paying by credit/debit card, Fees are billed automatically and charged to the credit/debit card on file on the Customer’s specific billing cycle date.  The specific billing cycle date typically begins on the day of the month that the subscription was initially purchased.</li>
			<li>For Customers paying by check, Fees must be paid from a bank account located in the United States.</li>
			<li>Customer is responsible for any Taxes (as defined in the Agreement), and Customer will pay all Fees without any reduction for Taxes.

			<li>Customers are responsible for maintaining current billing information.</li>
			<li>appsFreedom may charge a $100.00 fee for each individual credit/debit card chargeback submitted by Customer.</li>

			<li>Automatic renewal provisions are detailed in the Agreement.  Automatic renewal may be cancelled pursuant to Termination provisions detailed in the Agreement.</li>

      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
      <h1>Billing Disputes (applicable only to payments by credit/debit card)</h1>
		<p>Each current or former Customer agrees to provide appsFreedom 30 days to attempt to settle any billing dispute before Customer initiates any chargeback process with a third-party credit/debit card company or bank.  Upon receipt of a notice of initiation of a chargeback process by Customer, appsFreedom will Suspend all access to its products and services for that Customer until all outstanding billing disputes are resolved.  In the event appsFreedom receives notice of a chargeback process initiated by Customer from a third-party credit/debit card company or bank before providing appsFreedom an opportunity to resolve the issue prompting the initiation of the chargeback process, appsFreedom has the right to collect any Fees for rendered services associated with the dispute related to the initiation of the chargeback process.  Regardless of the outcome of the billing dispute with the third-party credit/debit card company or bank, appsFreedom retains the right to collect any Fees and associated charges.  appsFreedom retains the right to submit any disputed fees and related charges to a third-party collection agency.
