## LeanStack Features

> 100% Responsive drag and drop system for WordPress. Customize typography, colors, layout and user experience all without code.

`LeanStack is first and foremost a comprehensive web content platform which allows us to build themes, or stacks, based on the current or changing brand requirements. This is different from a theme, where only the current brand guidelines and requirements can be made whereas a stack allows many changes to occur`
